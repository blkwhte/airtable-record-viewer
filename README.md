This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This project allows for locating a specific Clever District SSO or Clever Library certification record in Airtable to view the submitted response after it's been submitted. 

## Getting Started

First, obtain an Airtable Personal Access Token. You can learn more on how to do that here: https://support.airtable.com/docs/creating-personal-access-tokens

Second, create a .env.local file in your project and include the following environment variables:

PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_TABLE_NAME=
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_ID=

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
